I am Wangtao Sun, currently a PhD student/candidate at the Institution of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am fortunate to be working under the guidance of [Prof. Kang Liu](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/~liukang/index.html). My research interests lie in the field of neuro-symbolic learning and the induction and reasoning of large large language models.
